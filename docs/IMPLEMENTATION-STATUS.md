## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. **Chunk Storage Simulation** - storeChunkData() is a NO-OP
2. **No Priority Queue** - All sync jobs treated equally
3. **Session Tokens** - Using random bytes instead of JWT
4. **No OpenTelemetry** - Limited visibility into system behavior
5. **No Load Testing** - Unknown performance characteristics at scale

### Medium Priority
1. **Excel Export** - Currently returns CSV as placeholder
2. **CDN Integration** - Using placeholder URLs
3. **Rate Limiting** - Not implemented
4. **Certificate Validation** - Basic device security only
5. **Automated Retention** - Manual cleanup required

### Low Priority
1. **Language Encoding** - Some Swedish characters display incorrectly
2. **Advanced Analytics** - Basic metrics only
3. **Webhook Infrastructure** - Add-on hooks not fully implemented
4. **AI Embedding** - Semantic search uses placeholder
5. **S1000D Parser** - Generic XML only
