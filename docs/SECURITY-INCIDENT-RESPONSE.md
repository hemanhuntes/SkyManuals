# Security Incident Response Plan

## Overview

This document outlines procedures for responding to security incidents affecting the SkyManuals aviation platform. All incidents are treated with maximum urgency due to potential aviation safety implications.

## Incident Severity Classification

### P0 - Critical Aviation Safety Impact
**Response Time**: Immediate (< 15 minutes)

**Examples:**
- Critical document tampering detected (AFM/MMEL modifications)
- Unauthorized access to flight operations data
- Data exfiltration of regulatory documents
- System compromise affecting multiple aircraft
- EFB sync failure during active flight operations

**Notifications:**
- CTO (direct SMS/call)
- CISO (direct SMS/call) 
- CEO (direct SMS/call)
- Flight Operations Manager
- Regulatory Officer
- Affected Customers (via encrypted channels)

### P1 - High Aviation Risk
**Response Time**: < 30 minutes

**Examples:**
- Authentication system compromise (but no data accessed)
- Rate limiting bypass attempts (potential DoS)
- Suspicious user account behavior (potential insider threat)
- Cross-organization data leakage
- EFB certificate compromise

**Notifications:**
- CISO + Engineering Lead
- Flight Operations Manager
- Customer Success Manager
- Security Team

### P2 - Medium Risk
**Response Time**: < 2 hours

**Examples:**
- Failed authentication spike (> 5x normal)
- Suspicious network traffic patterns
- Performance degradation with security implications
- Individual user account compromise (non-aviation roles)

**Notifications:**
- On-call Security Engineer
- Engineering Manager
- Customer Success (if customer affected)

### P3 - Low Risk
**Response Time**: < 24 hours

**Examples:**
- Minor vulnerability notifications
- Non-critical compliance violations
- Security awareness training triggers
- Infrastructure security updates

**Notifications:**
- Security Team
- Documentation Team (for process updates)

## Response Procedures

### P0 Critical Response (< 15 minutes)

#### Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Immediate system isolation
./scripts/emergency-isolation.sh --severity=P0

# 2. Preserve forensic evidence
./scripts/capture-evidence.sh --timestamp=$(date +%s)

# 3. Assess aviation safety impact
./scripts/safety-assessment.sh --scope=critical_operations
```

**Manual Actions Required:**
1. **System Isolation**
   - Disable affected services/service accounts
   - Block suspicious IP addresses
   - Activate emergency maintenance mode

2. **Evidence Preservation**
   - Capture system snapshots
   - Export audit logs from last 72 hours
   - Preserve network traffic captures

3. **Aviation Safety Assessment**
   - Identify affected aircraft/flights
   - Determine if flight operations can continue safely
   - Activate emergency contact procedures if needed

#### Investigation Phase (15-60 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Automated forensic analysis
./scripts/forensic-analysis.sh --scope=critical_systems

## Recovery and Business Continuity

### EFB Alternative Procedures
If EFB system is compromised during flight operations:

```
1. Emergency Procedures Activation
   - Switch to paper-based procedures
   - Activate backup manual processes
   - Coordinate with local air traffic control
   
2. Data Integrity Verification
   - Manual document comparison
   - Third-party verification if available
   - Regulatory authority coordination
   
3. System Recovery Priority
   - Authentication systems first
   - Critical flight documents second
   - Full operational capability third
```

### Customer Support Escalation
```
Level 1: Automated Ticket Creation
Level 2: Security Team Review  
Level 3: Aviation Expert Consultation
Level 4: Regulatory Authority Coordination
Level 5: Executive Leadership Involvement
```

### Financial Impact Assessment
